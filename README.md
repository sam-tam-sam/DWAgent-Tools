A powerful batch script that configures [DWService](https://www.dwservice.net/en/home.html) for stealth operation, hiding it from system views while maintaining full functionality.

## About DWService

DWService is a free remote management service that allows you to securely access and control remote computers through any browser. It provides features like:

- Remote desktop control
- File transfer
- Command shell access
- System monitoring
- Process management

This script enhances DWService by making it virtually invisible on the target system.

## Features

### üîí Configuration Updates
- Modifies DWAgent configuration to disable tray icons
- Sets desktop notifications to "autohide" mode
- Applies custom configuration settings for optimal stealth operation

### üïµÔ∏è Stealth Capabilities
- Hides DWAgent from the uninstall programs list
- Removes DWAgent shortcuts from the Start Menu
- Hides desktop shortcuts while preserving functionality
- Makes the service completely invisible to casual system inspection

### üõ°Ô∏è Safety Features
- Creates automatic backups before making changes
- Checks for administrator privileges before execution
- Verifies existing configurations to avoid unnecessary changes
- Only restarts services when absolutely necessary

## Requirements

- Windows operating system
- DWAgent installed (from https://www.dwservice.net/)
- Administrator privileges to run the script

## Installation & Usage

1. Download the latest DWAgent from [DWService.net](https://www.dwservice.net/)
2. Install DWAgent on your target system
3. Download `DWAgent-Tools.bat`
4. Right-click on the script and select "Run as administrator"
5. Follow the on-screen instructions

The script will automatically:
- Check if it is running with administrator privileges
- Verify that DWAgent is installed
- Create a backup of existing configuration files
- Apply stealth configurations
- Hide DWAgent from system views
- Restart the service if needed

## How It Works

### Configuration Modification
The script modifies two key files:

1. **config.json**: Updates the configuration to:
   - Disable tray icons (`"monitor_tray_icon": false`)
   - Set desktop notifications to none (`"monitor_desktop_notification": "none"`)
   - Apply custom connection settings

2. **monitor.py**: Changes the notification behavior to "autohide" for additional stealth

### System Integration
The script makes several system changes to hide DWAgent:

1. **Registry Modification**: Adds the `SystemComponent` flag to the uninstall registry entry
2. **Start Menu Cleanup**: Removes all DWAgent shortcuts and folders
3. **Desktop Shortcut Hiding**: Sets the hidden attribute on any desktop shortcuts

### Backup System
Before making any changes, the script creates a timestamped backup folder at `C:\DWAgent_Backup_YYYYMMDD_HHMM` containing:
- Original config.json (if modified)
- Original monitor.py (if modified)

## Technical Details

### File Locations
- DWAgent Directory: `C:\Program Files\DWAgent`
- Configuration File: `C:\Program Files\DWAgent\config.json`
- Monitor File: `C:\Program Files\DWAgent\ui\monitor.py`

### Registry Changes
```
HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\CurrentVersion\Uninstall\DWAgent
SystemComponent = 1 (DWORD)
```

## Troubleshooting

### "Please run this script as administrator!"
The script requires administrator privileges to modify system files and registry settings. Right-click the script and select "Run as administrator".

### "DWAgent directory not found"
Ensure that DWAgent is properly installed on your system before running this script.

### Service fails to restart
If the DWAgent service fails to restart after configuration changes, you can manually restart it:
1. Open Services (services.msc)
2. Find "DWAgent" in the list
3. Right-click and select "Restart"
